                <h5>#1:Clean the air</h5>
                <p class="tm-margin-b-20">
    
             For all the talk about air quality, you’d think the outdoors poses your biggest risk.
              But here’s a not-so-fun fact: indoor air is two to five times more polluted than outside
               air, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, thanks to all the dust, dander,
                and airborne contaminants. This can cause a slew of health issues, from asthma and allergies
                 to headaches and less restful sleep.

            <h5>What to do:</h5> Simple measures go a long way. For instance, vacuuming once a week or so will minimize
             dust and other particulates, especially if your vacuum is equipped with a HEPA filter, which captures
              even the finest contaminants. Using candles and wood-burning fireplaces sparingly is also important 
              since smoke can be a serious irritant. And stick to household cleaners that are low in volatile 
              organic compounds, or VOCs, as some of those can lead to serious health issues, including cancer.
              If your home uses central heating and cooling, change the filter every couple of months. Consider asking
               your HVAC pro about upgrading your filter from the standard 1-inch thick variety to an advanced
                4-inch thick filter, as this will do a much better job of scrubbing the air as it moves throug
                h the system. 
                <h5>#2: Biophylic environments</h5>
                 Have you heard of the term biophilia? It refers to humans' innate draw towards nature.  Carr thinks of biophilic design as a fully 
                   integrated “environmental quality” with the power to reduce stress, enhance creativity and 
                   clarity of thought, improve well-being, and expedite healing. And, there's something to that.
                    Researchers have found that exposure to biophilic environments has a larger restorative impact
                     on someone's well-being than non-biophilic environments.
                                 
                 <h5>What to do:</h5>
                  Whether you’re considering a major renovation or simply refreshing your space with
                  a few new pieces, one of the best ways to foster a connection with nature is to blur the line 
                  between the indoors and out. This can mean adding big picture windows, multi-panel doors (walls 
                  of glass that slide or fold open), or even just making a point to open your curtains as soon as you get out of bed.
                 The key takeaway, Carr says, is that biophilia doesn’t have to require a major investment.
                  “One of my favorite ways to incorporate it is with live plants,” he says. “The soothing visuals
                   that plants add to a room, the scent of their blooms and soil, the sound of leaves rustling in
                    the wind, the feel of their glossy leaves on your fingertips…all offer a sensory symphony of
                     experience.”

                    Sorting out grimy grout is an easy way to give your bathroom a makeover.
                     Grout can get dirty very quickly, so it's important to stay on top of cleaning
                      it to keep your bathroom sparkling.
                    Cleaning grout in your bathroom might also have some other benefits, too.
                     According to research by Checkatrade, 37% of UK homeowners choose to focus
                      on their bathrooms when renovating their homes, with industry experts confirming
                       the room most likely to give you the best return on investment is your bathroom.                 
                    Whether you're looking to sell your home or just want to spruce up your bathroom,
                     cleaning grout is an easy way to get this room sparkling again. The best part? 
                     It's less effort than you'd think. Just follow these simple steps...

                     <img src="img/blog3b.jpg" alt="Image" class="tm-margin-b-30 img-fluid">

                    <h5>Step One</h5>
                    Mix together bicarbonate of soda and water to make a paste, then
                     rub on to dirty grout using an old toothbrush.
                   An electric toothbrush with an old head will also work wonders and save your
                   elbows! Work it well into the grout.

                   <h5>Step Two</h5>
                   Fill a spray bottle with vinegar and spray it over the bicarb mix.
                    It should start bubbling up into a thick mixture that is perfect for tackling grout.

                    <h5>Step Three</h5>
                    Use your toothbrush to scrub away the grime. Rinse well with water.

                    <img src="img/blog4.jpg" alt="Image" class="tm-margin-b-30 img-fluid">
                    <p class="tm-margin-b-20">
                        Every home has a unique scent. Still, some houses — we hate to say it — 
                        smell better than others. No matter how clean you keep your house, there
                         are tons of odors that will develop naturally, especially when you factor
                          in the inevitable pet mess, overflowing trash can, and smelly shoe collection.
                           Although some smells require more elbow grease and patience (like, ya know,
                            when your pup decides your carpet is a bathroom), there are tons of ways to
                             freshen up your home's overall aroma on a daily basis.
                        We turned to top interior designers to get their best tips on how to make your
                         house smell good (or even, better than good), tackling everything from grimy
                          microwaves to musty closets. While you may be tempted to burn a few fragrant
                           candles for a quick aroma fix, work your way down this list to deodorize 
                            house from top to bottom, starting with the stinky garbage disposal in your
                             kitchen sink.
                            <h5>Clean your garbage disposals</h5>
                             Notice a lingering stink in your kitchen? If so, check the sink. "To get rid 
                             of the odor in your garbage disposal, spritz a dollop of lemon-scented dish
                              soap down into the disposal, run the water, then turn it on," says interior
                               designer Keita Turner. You can also run lemon or lime rinds through the disposal,
                                followed by lots of water. If the smell persists, pour a 1/2 cup of baking soda
                                 into the garbage disposal while running warm water.

                                <h5>Refresh carpets and rugs</h5>
                                Unlike tile and hardwood floors, plush carpets absorb stench like no other,
                                especially after countless food spills and pet messes. Sprinkle baking soda
                                all over the carpet — not just problem areas, and let sit for a few hours 
                                before vacuuming. The same method works for pet beds and mattresses, if you 
                                want to tackle other pain points in your house.
                                <img src="img/blog4b.jpg" alt="Image" class="tm-margin-b-30 img-fluid">
                                   <h5>Spruce up your trash can</h5>
                                   It's no surprise that the combination of odors from food scraps, leftovers,
                                    and other garbage creates an unpleasant stench. But come to find out, sometimes
                                    it's the trash can itself that smells the worst. While deep cleaning your kitchen,
                                    sprinkle baking soda in your trash can or use a deodorizing pack or pod, like
                                    Fresh Wave, under the can's liner. Finish it off by using a disinfecting spray
                                    to kill remaining bacteria.

                              <h5>Bring the outside in</h5>
                              "Indoor plants clean the air while instantly beautifying your home," says
                               Turner. Many plants, including jasmine, eucalyptus, and gardenias, offer
                                pleasant fragrances too. Just make sure you're prepared to care for them.
                               
                            <h5>Deodarize with dryer sheets</h5>
                            Think beyond the laundry room: "Place a few dryer sheets in closets, dressers
                             or other small spaces," says DelaCruz. It gives everything a fresh-out-the-
                             laundry scent even if it's been stowed away for months.
