                        <p>
                          Interior design not just stands with a look and beauty, added to beauty it
                          also has ability to showcase even a studio apartment as residence which has
                          enough space with the help of proper design and comforting lighting. Whereas,
                          a poor interior design makes a larger house that lack space. Interior designers
                          are experts in creating more spaces, improving the space efficiency, improving
                          the functional usage of space, improving the lighting effect, improving the 
                          color effects, improving the textures, patterns, scale, size etc. They are also
                          experts in selecting fittings & equipment. To be precise, it is all about transforming
                           people’s lives and makes their life a better one. Hence interior design is much 
                           important than it seem.
                          Simple fact to hire an interior designer is that they understand the need of 
                          the owner and brings their dream 
                          home alive. They also can design the house according to vastu (vasthu) or any
                           tradition as per the client’s demand which is an added advantage. Another
                            benefit to have a better interior designed home is that it will fetch higher bids
                             during the sale of the house than any other.
